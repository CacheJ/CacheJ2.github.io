<h2>About Me</h2>
<p> My name is Cache Jones and I am from Blythewood South Carolina. I am currently 20 and a junior at the University of South Carolina. In my free time I love to enjoy time with friends, go to the pool, try new food spots, go to the gym, and have movie nights. My favorite color is aqua blue and my favorite food is pasta and wings.</p>.

	<span id="first"></span></p><p><span id="more">As far as my collegiate involvement I am a Biology major on the pre-med track. On top of that I am a member of the Black Medical Student Association and the Multicultural Student Outreach Team. I also serve as a site leader for the LSC's Service Saturday and am the Community Outreach Director for The Big Event: A campus-wide day of service. Being that I am passionate about the community I grew up in and USC offers resources to cater to this,  I love being apart of organizations that uplift my interests and values.</span></p>
		

<h2> My Future Career Plans</h2>
<p>Since I was in middle school I knew I wanted to have a career in medicine, it wasnt until high school that I found apassion for sports medince. I was an athlete throughout all of my years in middle and high school and had aspirations of playing in college but when COVID hit, those plans changed. During my senior year I suffered a severely sprained ankle and while this was very painful it drove my passion to be a sports orthopaedic surgeon focusing on ankles and knee replacement. I plan attend medical school at MUSC School of Medicine in Charleston SC after completing my undergraduate studies. </p>

	<span id="first"></span></p><p><span id="more">Since being in college, I have already started working on surrounding myself in enviroments similar to one that I will eventually work in. I have secured an internship at Midlands Orthopardics and Nuerosurgery as a research intern under Dr. Thomas Gross, a sports orthopeadic surgeon. Working for someone who works directly in the field  that I plan to embark upon has been rewarding. From this experience I have learned more about patient care, post-operative activity, am in the process of writing a publication, and I was even able to view a surgery in the OR! Whats most exciting about this is that the internship is not over yet and I know there is much more to learn. The things I have learned and experienced here have given me even more of a passion for medicine and is driving me to succeed.</p>.
